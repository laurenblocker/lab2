    <p>Welcome to One Shop! The only online thrift shop you will ever need! The online website where you will be able to learn about sustainability, thrift right from your bed, gather inspiration to grow your personal style, find a list of local thrift shops to donate to, and so much more! </p>
    <h2>Why should you thrift?</h2>
    <p>Besides spending less money on clothes and having a unique style, by choosing to buy secondhand clothing instead of brand new, you reduce waste and aid the planet! In the United States alone, individuals throw out 60 to 80 pounds of textile waste each year, and this can take months and even years for these materials to fully break down in landfills! </p>
